# A PyTorch implementation of 3D U-Net for filopodia segmentation

This is an PyTorch implementation of the 3D U-Net descibed in the paper: [3-D Quantification of Filopodia in Motile Cancer Cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30296215/) by Castilla et al. (2017). The code was written as a reproducibility project for the Deep Learning course at the TU Delft.
